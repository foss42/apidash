# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:
    # This section identifies this Flutter project as a plugin project.
    # The 'pluginClass' specifies the class (in Java, Kotlin, Swift, Objective-C, etc.)
    # which should be registered in the plugin registry. This is required for
    # using method channels.
    # The Android 'package' specifies package in which the registered class is.
    # This is required for using method channels on Android.
    # The 'ffiPlugin' specifies that native code should be built and bundled.
    # This is required for using `dart:ffi`.
    # All these are used by the tooling to maintain consistency when
    # adding or updating assets for this project.
    #
    # Please refer to README.md for a detailed explanation.
