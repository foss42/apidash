### **Motivation & Past Experience**  

1. **Have you worked on or contributed to a FOSS project before?**  
   Yes, I have contributed to various open-source projects, including API Dash. You can check out my PR here: [PR #727](https://github.com/foss42/apidash/pull/727).  
   In this pull request, I have detailed all the work I have done, along with videos. Please check it out!  

2. **What is one project/achievement you are most proud of? Why?**  
   I have worked with multiple startups and started my first job in my second year as a Flutter developer. Over time, I learned backend and frontend development and built more than 20 web apps and some AI models.  
   One project that I am really proud of is **Mukham App**, which my team and I built. It completely changed how the attendance system worked in our college for teachers. We used geo-fencing and facial recognition, which helped streamline attendance tracking across the entire college.  

3. **What kind of problems or challenges motivate you the most to solve them?**  
   I love solving complex backend and UI/UX challenges, especially those involving API integrations, data visualization, and automation.  
   More than that, I like working on innovative challenges—things that no one has ever tried before. If I get an idea, I just want to build it and see where it goes!  

4. **Will you be working on GSoC full-time?**  
   Yes, I will be working on GSoC full-time. I am currently in my 4th year, and I don’t have any classes or exams going on, so I am completely free to dedicate my time to this project.  

5. **Do you mind regularly syncing up with the project mentors?**  
   No, I am totally fine with regular sync-ups and discussions. It’s actually something I prefer because it helps in making sure everything is on track and moving in the right direction.  

6. **What interests you the most about API Dash?**  
   API Dash makes working with APIs really smooth and efficient. The way it helps in testing and documenting APIs is super useful for developers.  
   But the main reason I got interested in API Dash was when I first started looking at GSoC projects. I checked out more than 25 organizations, joined their chats, and looked at their Slack groups. Out of all of them, API Dash stood out the most because the community was **active, helpful, and really engaging**—even when students had small doubts. That kind of support is what I liked the most!  

7. **Can you mention some areas where the project can be improved?**  
   - **Better UI/UX for API visualizations.**  
   - **More integrations** with third-party services.  
   - **Refining API documentation generation** (which I have already worked on in my PR).  
   - **Keeping an eye on competitors** like Postman and others—seeing what new features they release and thinking about what we can build and release faster for users.

### **Project Proposal Information**  

1. **Proposal Title:** DashBot – The AI Assistant for API Dash  

2. **Abstract:**  
   API development involves a lot of repetitive tasks—debugging requests, understanding responses, writing documentation, and visualizing data. Developers often spend hours on these, which could be automated.  
   **DashBot** aims to solve this by introducing an **AI-powered assistant** inside API Dash that will **help developers automate tedious tasks, follow best practices, and interact with APIs using natural language.**  
   The goal is to make API workflows **faster, smarter, and more intuitive**, saving developers time and effort.    

3. **Detailed Description:**  
   This project will focus on building **DashBot** as a **modular and extensible AI assistant** that seamlessly integrates with API Dash. The main objectives include:  

   - **Explaining API Responses & Debugging Errors**  
     DashBot will analyze API responses, detect issues based on status codes & error messages, and provide actionable insights to fix them.  

   - **Generating API Documentation Automatically**  
     Developers will be able to generate structured and well-formatted API documentation based on request and response data. This will help in keeping docs up-to-date effortlessly.  

   - **Visualizing API Responses with Customizable Charts**  
     DashBot will generate **interactive plots** and **customizable visualizations** to help developers make sense of API data quickly.  

   - **Understanding APIs & Generating Test Cases**  
     Instead of manually writing test cases, DashBot will **analyze API responses** and auto-generate test cases to validate API functionality.  

   - **Improving the API Request Experience**  
     Users will get **auto-suggestions** for API parameters, headers, and request structures to improve efficiency and reduce errors.  

   - **Keeping It Fast & Efficient**  
     The implementation will focus on keeping DashBot **lightweight, responsive, and easy to use** within API Dash without slowing anything down.
