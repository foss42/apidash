# Run Generated Code

This guide explains how to run the code generated by API Dash for different programming languages.

## Python

- Official installation: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Install dependency (`requests`):

```bash
pip install requests
```

- Run generated file:

```bash
python generated_request.py
```

## JavaScript (Node.js)

- Official installation: [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Install dependency (`axios`):

```bash
npm install axios
```

- Run generated file:

```bash
node generated_request.js
```

## Java

- Official installation: [https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/)
- Install dependency: No extra dependency required for Java `HttpClient` code.

- Run generated file:

```bash
# Compile the Java file
javac GeneratedApiCode.java

# Run the compiled class
java GeneratedApiCode
```

- `GeneratedApiCode.java` should be replaced with your generated filename.
- This works with any standard JDK (Temurin, OpenJDK, etc.) and does not require Maven/Gradle unless the generated code explicitly uses them.
