## Motivation & Past Experience  

### 1. FOSS Contributions  
I haven't contributed to FOSS projects yet, but I recently downloaded the APIDash codebase to my local machine and started exploring it to understand its structure and functionality.  

### 2. Proud Achievement  
One of my proudest achievements is the **KissanYukt project**—a mobile app developed for farmers to connect directly with consumers, eliminating middlemen and ensuring fair pricing. This project led us to victory in the **Smart India Hackathon**, showcasing our ability to develop impactful solutions for real-world problems.  

### 3. Challenges that Motivate Me  
I enjoy solving problems that require creativity, logical thinking, and a direct impact on people’s lives. Whether it’s optimizing a process, improving user experience, or automating repetitive tasks, I find motivation in challenges that push me to learn, adapt, and innovate.  

### 4. GSoC Commitment  
I will be working part-time on GSoC, as I am a 2nd-year student and need to balance my studies alongside the project.  

### 5. Syncing with Mentors  
Yes, I am open to regular sync-ups with project mentors to ensure steady progress.  

### 6. Interest in APIDash  
APIDash stands out because of its lightweight, Flutter-based architecture, making it a highly efficient alternative to tools like Postman. I am particularly excited about the potential of expanding its modular design, enhancing API discovery, and integrating AI-based automation for better API management.  

### 7. Project Improvements  
While APIDash provides a great developer experience, some areas for improvement include:  
- Improving UI responsiveness on lower-end devices.  
- Expanding API import/export options for better interoperability.  
- Enhancing API security validation and error handling mechanisms.  

## Project Proposal Information  

### Proposal Title: API Explorer for APIDash  

### Abstract  
This project aims to enhance the APIDash user experience by integrating a curated library of popular and publicly available APIs. The feature will allow users to discover, browse, search, and import API endpoints into their workspace for seamless testing. It will include pre-configured API request templates with authentication details, sample payloads, and expected responses, reducing manual setup time.  

## Weekly Timeline  

| **Week**     | **Focus**                              | **Key Deliverables & Achievements** |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Week 1-2** | Community Bonding & Planning       | Engage with the APIDash team, review the existing codebase, and gather insights. Define project scope, objectives, and a clear technical roadmap. **Outcome:** Detailed project plan and initial architecture design. |
| **Week 3-4** | API Parsing & Categorization       | Develop a backend parser to extract API endpoints, request methods, and metadata from OpenAPI/HTML files. Implement an auto-tagging mechanism to categorize APIs effectively. **Outcome:** A functional parser that outputs structured API data. |
| **Week 5-6** | Data Enrichment & Template Generation | Build the automation pipeline to enrich parsed API data—adding details like sample payloads, authentication requirements, and expected responses. Generate pre-configured API request templates automatically. **Outcome:** End-to-end pipeline for creating API templates. |
| **Week 7-8** | UI Integration & Search Functionality | Integrate the backend pipeline with APIDash’s frontend. Develop a user-friendly interface for browsing, searching, and importing APIs into the workspace. **Outcome:** Interactive API Explorer UI with smooth API discovery and import features. |
| **Week 9-10**| Community Features & Optimization  | Implement optional community features such as user ratings and reviews, and enhance GitHub integration for community contributions. Fine-tune performance and usability based on user feedback. **Outcome:** A more engaging and optimized tool for API discovery. |
| **Week 11-12**| Testing, Documentation & Finalization | Conduct comprehensive end-to-end testing, resolve any issues, and prepare detailed documentation and user guides. **Outcome:** A robust, well-documented API Explorer ready for deployment and community use. |

## Conclusion  
The **API Explorer for APIDash** project aims to enhance user experience by providing a seamless way to discover, browse, and integrate publicly available APIs. By automating API parsing, categorization, and enrichment, the project will reduce onboarding time and improve efficiency for developers.  

This project aligns well with my skills and interests, and I am eager to contribute to the APIDash ecosystem through this project.
