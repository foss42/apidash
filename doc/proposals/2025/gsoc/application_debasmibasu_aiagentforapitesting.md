## Project Proposal

### **Title**

AI-Powered API Testing and Tool Integration

### **Abstract**

API testing often requires **manual test case creation and validation**, making it inefficient. Additionally, **converting APIs into structured definitions for AI integration** is a complex task. This project aims to **automate test generation, response validation, and structured API conversion** using **LLMs and AI agents.** The system will provide **automated debugging insights** and integrate seamlessly with **pydantic-ai** and **langgraph.** A **benchmarking dataset** will also be created to evaluate various LLMs for API testing tasks.
