## Motivation & Past Experience

### 1. Have you worked on or contributed to a FOSS project before? Can you attach repo links or relevant PRs?
No, I haven't contributed to a FOSS project before, but I'm eager to start with this GSoC opportunity.

### 2. What is your one project/achievement that you are most proud of? Why?

Built a Telegram bot where devs stuck with errors can send screenshots - bot auto-shares with top 50 coders in network. First correct solution earns points, live leaderboard shows who helps most. Went crazy viral - 1000+ users in weeks, my AWS CloudFront quota finished because too many screenshots! Had to quickly switch to Telegram's storage. Used Python + MongoDB + Redis. Learned real scaling pains when server crashed from 500+ users at once. Saw how points system makes people compete to help better. Dropped fancy image processing - simple sharing worked best. This bot proved devs need quick solutions. Now want to bring same "fast help" idea to API Dash - make finding APIs easy like my bot made fixing errors easy. Already know how to handle traffic spikes and build things people actually use daily.

### 3. What kind of problems or challenges motivate you the most to solve them?
- What I love most is that these aren't just coding problems - they need me to understand how real developers work and what would actually help them. When I finally crack a tough one, it feels amazing

### 4. Will you be working on GSoC full-time? In case not, what will you be studying or working on while working on the project?
Yes, I will be working on GSoC full-time during the coding period.

### 5. Do you mind regularly syncing up with the project mentors?
No, I welcome regular sync-ups with mentors. I believe frequent communication is crucial for project success.

### 6. What interests you the most about API Dash?
What interests me most is that:

- Unlike closed-source alternatives like Postman, API Dash is open-source  
- It allows community-driven improvements  
- We can implement features that users genuinely need  
- It provides transparency in API testing tools  

### 7. Can you mention some areas where the project can be improved?
Potential improvement areas include:

#### UI/UX Enhancements:
- Moving endpoints tab to a more prominent position  
- Creating a more familiar interface for new users  

#### Protocol Support:
- Adding testing support for gRPC  
- Implementing WebSocket testing  
- Supporting Server-Sent Events (SSE)  

#### Authentication:
- Expanding supported auth methods  
- Improving token management  
- Adding OAuth 2.0 flows  

#### Documentation:
- More comprehensive API testing guides  
- Better onboarding materials  
- Tutorial videos

### **IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS**
# API Explorer Implementation Guide

## Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

### 1. Repository Structure for API CATALOGS
```bash
api-catalog/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ process.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sources/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {category}/  
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ api-name.yaml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ generated/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {category}/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ api-name.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ processor.dart
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ validate.dart
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ validate.dart
 (We can also use Python scripts in this automation instead of Dart, as our main purpose is to generate the JSON files and then update them in the final repository)
```
