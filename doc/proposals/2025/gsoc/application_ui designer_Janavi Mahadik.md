### Motivation & Past Experience

1. *Have you worked on or contributed to a FOSS project before?*
  While I haven’t contributed to any major public FOSS project yet, I have built full-stack projects like Khanawal (my own project) and 
  participated in hackathons and collaborative academic projects which follow open-source development practices. 
  I am eager to contribute meaningfully to real-world open-source projects like API Dash.

2. *What is your one project/achievement that you are most proud of? Why?*
  I’m most proud of Khanawal, a full-stack food ordering and management system that I built independently using Flutter, React.js, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Firebase. 
  It gave me real-world experience in integrating frontends, backends, and databases using REST APIs, and taught me how to manage user roles, build UIs, and implement analytics.

3. *What kind of problems or challenges motivate you the most to solve them?*
  I enjoy solving challenges that bridge the gap between complex backend data and meaningful user interfaces—especially when it improves user experience and productivity. 
  Problems involving automation, visualization, or data interaction excite me the most.

4. *Will you be working on GSoC full-time? In case not, what will you be studying or working on while working on the project?*
  Yes, I will be available full-time during the GSoC period. While I will have regular college hours, I will ensure uninterrupted availability for project work and mentor sync-ups, 
  dedicating the required hours per week.

5. *Do you mind regularly syncing up with the project mentors?*
  Not at all! Regular communication helps align goals and expectations, and I am happy to schedule sync-ups, demos, or progress reports.

6. *What interests you the most about API Dash?*
  The idea of turning raw API responses into interactive, customizable UI elements excites me. It aligns well with my experience in full-stack development and my interest in combining backend logic 
  with intuitive frontends. I’m also excited to work with Flutter and real-time rendering tools.

7. *Can you mention some areas where the project can be improved?*
  - Introducing support for both JSON and XML parsing can increase compatibility.
  - Providing a visual drag-and-drop UI builder could enhance the user experience.
  - Integrating export templates for popular frameworks (e.g., React, Flutter widgets) can help with faster integration into apps.
  - Adding version control for UI snapshots or generated components could make the system more developer-friendly.




### Project Proposal Information

1. *Proposal Title:* AI UI Designer for APIs – Dynamic UI Generator from API Responses

2. *Abstract:* 
  This project aims to develop an AI-powered agent that automatically generates dynamic, user-friendly UI components from structured API responses (JSON/XML). 
  By analyzing the API structure, the agent will create UI elements such as tables, forms, charts, and cards, which users can customize and export into their Flutter/Web apps. 
  This eliminates manual UI coding and enhances the developer workflow.

3. *Detailed Description:*
  The system will accept API endpoints and parse the response structure (JSON/XML). Based on the data types and patterns, the agent will use AI-based heuristics and predefined rules to 
  create appropriate UI components:
  - Lists/tables for arrays of objects
  - Input forms for structured fields
  - Graphs for numerical trends
  - Cards for object summaries
  Users will have customization options to change styles, rearrange components, apply filters, pagination, and sorting. The generated UI will be exportable as code (Flutter widgets, HTML/CSS/JS for web apps) 
  for seamless integration. A real-time previewer will also be included for live editing and visualization.

4. *Weekly Timeline:*
| Week   | Goals / Activities                                                                 | Deliverables                                                                                   |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Week 1 | Community bonding, understand the API Dash codebase and architecture, set up development environment | Local setup ready, active communication with mentors and community                            |
