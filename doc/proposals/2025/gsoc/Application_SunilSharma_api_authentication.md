### Motivation & Past Experience

1. **Have you worked on or contributed to a FOSS project before?**  
   Yes, I have actively contributed to open-source projects, including adding support for PHP, Rust, and Golang, improving UI elements, and enhancing test coverage for various repositories. Some of my notable contributions:  
   - Added support for PHP, Rust, and Golang in an online compiler.  
   - Improved UI/UX for an online coding platform.  
   - Introduced a Python script for OpenAI key validation.  
   - Link to relevant PR: https://github.com/kalviumcommunity/compilerd/pull/139  
   While my PR was not merged, it was due to a shift in project priorities, and the maintainers appreciated my effort and provided constructive feedback, which helped me refine my contributions.

2. **What is your one project/achievement that you are most proud of? Why?**  
   One of my proudest achievements is my project on **Self-Optimizing and Intelligent Cloud Infrastructure**. This system integrates AWS Predictive Auto-Scaling with CloudWatch monitoring and cost optimization techniques, reducing infrastructure costs by â‚¹766.82 per month. This project showcases my expertise in **cloud computing, automation, and cost optimization** while making real-world impact.  

3. **What kind of problems or challenges motivate you the most to solve them?**  
I like working on problems that push me to improve efficiency, enhance security, and automate complex processes. Challenges in **API authentication, cloud infrastructure, and scalable systems** interest me the most because they require a balance of security, optimization, and real-world application.  

4. **Will you be working on GSoC full-time?**  
   Yes, I will be working full-time on my GSoC project.  

5. **Do you mind regularly syncing up with the project mentors?**  
   Not at all! Regular sync-ups will help ensure alignment with project goals and continuous improvement.  

6. **What interests you the most about API Dash?**  
   API Dash is a lightweight and efficient API testing tool that avoids the unnecessary complexity of other platforms. I like how it keeps things simple while integrating AI to make API testing more intuitive and developer-friendly.  

7. **Can you mention some areas where the project can be improved?**  
   - **Authentication Mechanisms**: Implementing **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**, including biometric authentication, will enhance security and improve user experience. Having worked on MFA in payment gateways, I can integrate fingerprint recognition to streamline authentication, reducing reliance on passwords while ensuring security. Secure storage will protect credentials, allowing seamless and fast authentication for valid users on both mobile and laptop platforms.
