5. **Do you mind regularly syncing up with the project mentors?**  
   - No, I am open to regular sync-ups to ensure the projectâ€™s success.

6. **What interests you the most about API Dash?**  
   - I am excited about building AI-driven UI generation from API responses, as it aligns with my expertise in Flutter and AI integration. I also enjoy automating tasks to improve user experience.

7. **Can you mention some areas where the project can be improved?**  
   - One area for improvement is enhancing the AI model to suggest optimized UI layouts based on the data format, making the interface more intuitive for the user.

### Project Proposal Information

1. **Proposal Title:** AI-Powered UI Designer for API Responses with Gemini AI API 
2. **Abstract:** The project aims to develop an AI-based system that automatically generates user-friendly UI components from API responses. It will analyze JSON/XML data and generate UI components like tables, forms, and charts. Customization options such as filters, pagination, and sorting will be integrated. The generated UI can be exported and integrated into Flutter or Web apps.
3. **Detailed Description:**  
   - **Analyze API Responses:** Develop a mechanism to parse JSON/XML structures and categorize data fields.  
   - **Generate Dynamic UI Components:** Use Flutter to automatically create UI elements like tables, forms, and cards based on API response formats.  
   - **Implement Customization Options:** Add filters, sorting, and pagination controls to enhance UI usability.  
   - **AI Integration:** Leverage Gemini AI to suggest optimized UI layouts and improve the user experience.  
   - **Export & Integration:** Allow users to export the generated UI and integrate it seamlessly into their projects.
4. **Weekly Timeline:**  
   - **Week 1-2:** Research and understand the API Dash structure, implement basic API response parsing for JSON/XML.  
   - **Week 3-5:** Develop the Flutter UI component generation mechanism, test with sample API responses.  
   - **Week 6-7:** Implement AI-driven suggestions for UI layouts using Gemini AI, enhance UI interactivity.  
   - **Week 8-9:** Integrate filters, pagination, and sorting controls into the UI components.  
   - **Week 10:** Finalize the export and integration functionality.  
   - **Week 11-12:** Conduct testing, bug fixes, and prepare for documentation.
