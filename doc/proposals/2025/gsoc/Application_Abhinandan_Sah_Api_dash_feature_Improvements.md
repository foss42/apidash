## Motivation & Past Experience
1. **Have you worked on or contributed to a FOSS project before?**  
   Yes, I’ve contributed to open-source projects on GitHub, sharpening my skills in collaborative coding. My profile ([github.com/Abhinandan-Sah](https://github.com/Abhinandan-Sah)) includes **DevConnect** ([github.com/Abhinandan-Sah/DevConnect](https://github.com/Abhinandan-Sah/DevConnect)), which I intend to open-source, showcasing real-world development experience.  

2. **What is your one project/achievement that you are most proud of? Why?**  
   I take pride in **DevConnect** (Feb 2025 – Mar 2025), a full-stack developer networking platform ([github.com/Abhinandan-Sah/DevConnect](https://github.com/Abhinandan-Sah/DevConnect)). This Tinder-like app for devs features real-time chat, audio/video calls, and a smart matching algorithm. It’s a standout achievement because it integrates complex technologies like Socket.IO and AWS, reflecting my ability to build scalable, interactive solutions.  

3. **What kind of problems or challenges motivate you the most to solve them?**  
   I’m driven by challenges that improve user experiences, integrate cutting-edge tech (e.g., real-time systems, APIs), and enhance scalability. Creating tools like API Dash or platforms like DevConnect that solve real-world problems fuels my passion.  

4. **Will you be working on GSoC full-time?**  
   Yes, I’ll dedicate myself full-time to GSoC in the summer of 2025, focusing entirely on API Dash.  

5. **Do you mind regularly syncing up with the project mentors?**  
   Not at all—I thrive on collaboration and welcome regular mentor sync-ups to ensure alignment and quality.  

6. **What interests you the most about API Dash?**  
   API Dash’s goal of simplifying API testing aligns with my love for developer tools. Its Dart/Flutter stack excites me as a learning opportunity, and its open-source ethos matches my experience with projects like DevConnect.  

7. **Can you mention some areas where the project can be improved?**  
   From the issue tracker, I’d focus on:  
   - JSON body enhancements (syntax highlighting, validation, beautification - #581, #582, #583).  
   - Environment variable support in request bodies (#590–593).  
   - A richer GraphQL editor with schema inspection and variable support.

## Project Proposal Information

### 1. Proposal Title  
**Enhancing API Dash: JSON Body Improvements and Environment Variable Support**

### 2. Abstract  
This project will enrich API Dash by adding JSON request body syntax highlighting, validation, beautification, and environment variable support. These upgrades will provide developers with real-time JSON feedback, auto-formatting, and dynamic variable integration, boosting usability and efficiency using Dart and Flutter.

### 3. Detailed Description  
API Dash’s request body editor can become a more powerful tool with:  
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Color-coded JSON for enhanced readability.  
- **Validation**: Real-time syntax error detection with UI feedback.  
- **Beautification**: Auto and manual JSON formatting with proper indentation.  
- **Environment Variable Support**: Dynamic variables in JSON, text, and form bodies, linked to API Dash’s environment system.  

### 4. Weekly Timeline  
- **Week 1**: Explore API Dash codebase, set up dev environment, design JSON editor features.  
- **Week 2**: Implement JSON syntax highlighting with Flutter text widgets.  
- **Week 3**: Add real-time JSON validation with error messaging.  
- **Week 4**: Build beautification feature (auto/manual modes).  
- **Week 5**: Integrate environment variables in JSON request bodies.  
- **Week 6**: Extend variable support to text and form bodies (#591, #593).  
- **Week 7**: Develop unit and widget tests for all features.  
- **Week 8**: Polish UI, fix bugs, and document code.  
- **Week 9**: Buffer week for testing, mentor feedback, and refinements.  
- **Week 10**: Finalize PR, create demo, and submit documentation.  

**Total Hours**: ~175 hours (Medium difficulty)
