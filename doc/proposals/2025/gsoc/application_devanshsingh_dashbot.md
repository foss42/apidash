### Motivation & Past Experience

1. **Have you worked on a FOSS project before?**  
Yes! I have recently started contributing to API Dash itself, with PRs like my DashBot idea submission. I’m eager to explore more open-source contributions with community engagement.  


2. **One project/achievement you are proud of?**  
My ongoing work on a stock market web app with AI-based alerts. I’m building it with the MERN stack and integrating features like AI chatbots and trivia quizzes. This project helped me improve my full-stack dev skills.

3. **What kind of problems motivate you?**  
Creative technical challenges that involve clean UI + backend logic. I love when I can combine UX and AI tools to solve real problems.

4. **Will you work on GSoC full-time?**  
Yes! I’m committed to dedicating full-time during the GSoC coding period.

5. **Are you okay with regular mentor sync-ups?**  
Absolutely yes. I'm very active on Discord and GitHub.

6. **What interests you most about API Dash?**  
The simplicity and speed of the app! It’s refreshing how lightweight it is compared to Postman. DashBot, especially, excites me because of the AI + dev tooling blend.

7. **Areas to improve in the project?**  
- AI-assisted user onboarding  
- Chat-based debugging suggestions  
- Clearer error interpretation for APIs  
- Saving test histories across sessions

### Project Proposal Information

1. **Proposal Title**: DashBot – AI Assistant for API Dash

2. **Abstract**:  
DashBot is an intelligent assistant that enhances the API Dash user experience by providing a chat-based interface to help users write, debug, and understand API requests. It leverages LLMs to help beginners and pros alike work with APIs faster and with fewer errors. The assistant will be integrated as a widget within the app UI.

3. **Detailed Description**:  
- Integrate DashBot into the existing Flutter app as a chat UI.
- Build context-aware API guidance using a local LLM (or OpenAI fallback).
- Features:
  - Natural language to API translation
  - Error explanations and suggestions
  - Autofill headers/body
  - History of queries
- Structure:
  - Backend service (Python/Node.js) to connect with LLM
  - Frontend UI in Flutter using existing components
- Timeline involves:
  - UI prototyping
  - Backend API scaffolding
  - LLM response formatting
  - Testing and feedback integration

4. **Weekly Timeline**:  
_(Rough plan based on GSoC coding phases)_

| Week(s) | Activity |
|--------|----------|
| Community Bonding | Finalize scope, design chat UI, mentor sync-ups |
| Week 1–2 | Set up chat interface in Flutter |
| Week 3–4 | Build backend bridge to LLM, test with mock data |
| Week 5–6 | Integrate real LLM calls + prompt tuning |
| Week 7–8 | Add features: headers, body autofill, error explain |
| Week 9–10 | Feedback loop, refine UX, polish UI |
| Week 11–12 | Final testing, documentation, mentor demos |
