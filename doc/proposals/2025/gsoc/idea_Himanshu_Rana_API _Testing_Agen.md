## About Me:
I am a software developer focused on **AI automation**, **LLM-powered applications**, and backend development. My recent work centers on building intelligent agents that automate complex workflows, interact with APIs, and streamline CRUD operations using natural language. Iâ€™m also experienced in deploying **RAG-based systems** and integrating LLMs into production-ready tools. I'm an AI enthusiast, recently attended **BUILD WITH AI** event in Udaipur, Rajastan.

## Project Details  

### Project Title : API Tester and Tool Generator Agent

### **Description**  
*APITester and Tool Generator Agent* is a modular AI agent system that automates API testing and transforms APIs into structured tool definitions using Large Language Models (LLMs). It supports diverse input formats such as OpenAPI, GraphQL, Postman collections, gRPC, curl commands, raw endpoints, and natural language descriptions. By breaking down the pipeline into intelligent agents, the system streamlines test case generation, automated execution, validation, and tool generation for seamless integration with frameworks like crewAI, smolagents, langgraph, and pydantic-ai.

### **Key Features**

- **Multi-Format API Input Support:** Understands and parses OpenAPI, GraphQL, Postman, gRPC, NLP descriptions, and curl commands.  
- **LLM-Based Test Case Generator:** Automatically creates comprehensive test scenarios including edge cases and integration tests.  
- **Autonomous Test Execution & Validation:** Executes API calls, validates responses, and monitors correctness, performance, and schema adherence.  
- **Tool Definition Output:** Converts parsed APIs into usable tool schemas for integration with agent frameworks like crewAI and langgraph.  
- **Benchmarking Agent:** Evaluates LLM performance on test generation, validation accuracy, and tool-building quality to help users choose the best model.

##  Advantages Over Chained Pipeline Architecture

| Feature | Tool-Based Agentic Flow | Chained Pipeline |
|---------|-------------------------|------------------|
| **Dynamic Control** | LLM and Router decide next step contextually | Fixed step sequence |
| **Interactive Flow** | Can pause mid-way (e.g., for auth), resume on input | Needs complex workaround |
| **Modular Agents** | Each agent is plug-n-play, reusable | Hardcoded logic; tight coupling |
| **Skippable Steps** | Irrelevant tools can be skipped | All steps run, needed or not |
| **Human-in-the-Loop** | Naturally prompts for missing info (auth, clarification) | Not supported |
| **Flexible Branching** | LangGraph handles dynamic routing easily | Branching logic is cumbersome |
| **Better Memory** | Maintains state/context between agents | Manual context-passing needed |
| **Scalability** | New tools or agents can be added independently | Pipeline redesign needed |
| **Fine-Grained Testing** | Each tool can be unit tested separately | Testing requires end-to-end runs |
| **LLM-Driven Intelligence** | LLM chooses tools, generates test cases | LLM use is limited or step-bound |

|---------|------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| **Collaboration** | Agents work together through direct dialogue | Sequential processing only | Limited to tool calls |
| **Error Handling** | Collaborative troubleshooting | Predefined fallbacks | Main agent must handle all errors |
| **Processing Model** | Parallel agent conversations | Linear execution | Star topology with bottlenecks |
| **Adaptability** | Dynamic workflow adjustment | Fixed process flow | Limited branching options |
| **Knowledge Sharing** | Immediate across all agents | Sequential passing | Through central coordinator only |
| **Human Integration** | Natural dialogue with any agent | Process interruption | Limited to main agent |
| **Iterative Testing** | Continuous refinement cycles | Single-pass execution | Requires multiple complete runs |
| **Self-Improvement** | Learns from conversations | Static approach | Limited learning capabilities |
| **Complex APIs** | Strong reasoning about interdependencies | Struggles with complex state | Limited by main agent capabilities |
| **Scalability** | New agents easily integrated | Requires pipeline redesign | Tool registration overhead |

## Real-World Application Example

When testing a complex e-commerce API with authentication, inventory management, and payment processing:

1. **Parser Agent** recognizes the API has three interdependent service areas
2. **Auth Handler** identifies OAuth2 requirements and requests credentials
3. **Test Generator** and **Parser** discuss dependency order: auth â†’ inventory â†’ payment
4. **Test Executor** runs auth tests while **Test Generator** prepares inventory tests
5. When inventory tests reveal unexpected behavior, **Validator** and **Test Generator** immediately refine test cases
6. **Tool Definition Agent** observes patterns and generates specialized e-commerce API tools
7. **Benchmarking Agent** determines Claude 3 Opus performs best for this specific API's complexity
8. All insights are captured in the Knowledge Base for future testing sessions

This collaborative approach enables handling complex, interdependent API ecosystems that would overwhelm traditional testing architectures.

## Implementation Path

1. **Foundation Layer**
   - Implement conversation protocol and shared workspace
   - Create Multi-Format Parser with support for all input formats

2. **Agent Development**
