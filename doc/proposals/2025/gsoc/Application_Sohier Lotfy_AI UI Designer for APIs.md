### Motivation & Past Experience

Short answers to the following questions (Add relevant links wherever you can):
1. Have you worked on or contributed to a FOSS project before? Can you attach repo links or relevant PRs? 
  NO
2. What is your one project/achievement that you are most proud of? Why? 
  Audiobook generator, although it's non-professional project but it was an idea that came true and I thought of every single piece of it, and built it for myself as me the only user.
3. What kind of problems or challenges motivate you the most to solve them?
  the problems that requires creative thinking and the problems that once dug deep and found the core problem you can find the solution easily.
4. Will you be working on GSoC full-time? In case not, what will you be studying or working on while working on the project?
  No, I can work part-time as I am a mom and part time master student.
6. Do you mind regularly syncing up with the project mentors?
  NO
7. What interests you the most about API Dash?
  API Dash looks interesting because it's an open-source, lightweight alternative to Postman and Insomnia, with cross-platform support (including mobile). One standout feature is its ability to preview API responses for images, PDFs, audio, and videos, which most API clients don’t support. It also supports GraphQL, SSE, and WebSockets, making it versatile beyond just REST APIs. Another useful feature is its built-in code generation for multiple languages like Dart, Python, and JavaScript, which speeds up API integration. Since it's built with Flutter, it has a native feel across platforms and is highly customizable.
8. Can you mention some areas where the project can be improved?
  - The UI is lightweight, but when handling many APIs, navigation and search could be improved with tagging, categorization, or hierarchical collections.
  - It supports some languages, but expanding code snippet generation to include Swift, Kotlin, C#, and Rust would be useful.
  - While it has a clean UI, offering more customization, such as dark mode, font adjustments, and layout options, would enhance usability.

### Project Proposal Information

### **1. Proposal Title**  
**AI UI Designer for APIs – Automated Visualization of API Responses**  

### **2. Abstract**  
APIs return structured data in formats like JSON or XML, but developers often spend time manually creating UI components to visualize and interact with this data. This project aims to develop an AI-powered agent that automatically transforms API responses into dynamic, user-friendly UI components. The system will analyze API response structures and generate appropriate UI elements, such as tables, charts, forms, and cards, with customization options. This eliminates the need for manual UI development, improving efficiency and user experience. The generated UI components will be exportable for integration into Flutter or web applications.  

### **3. Detailed Description**  
#### **Problem Statement**  
When integrating APIs into applications, developers often need to create custom UI elements to present API responses in an understandable way. This process is time-consuming, repetitive, and requires both front-end and back-end expertise. Automating this step will streamline API consumption and enhance usability.  

#### **Proposed Solution**  
This project will develop an AI-driven system that:  
- Parses API responses (JSON, XML) to extract key data structures.  
- Automatically generates corresponding UI components (tables, charts, forms, cards).  
- Provides customization options for developers to modify layouts, styles, and interactive elements (filters, pagination, sorting).  
- Enables real-time UI updates based on API response variations.  
- Allows easy export of the generated UI components for use in Flutter or web applications.  

#### **Technical Approach**  
- **Data Parsing & Analysis**: Implement parsers to process API responses and extract hierarchical data.  
- **AI Model for UI Generation**: Use rule-based mapping and AI models to determine the best UI components for different response structures.  
- **Dynamic UI Rendering**: Implement a rendering engine in Flutter/Dart to visualize API data interactively.  
- **Customization & Exporting**: Provide UI customization options and an export function for Flutter/web integration.
