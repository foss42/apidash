Project Title: DashBot - AI Assistant for API Dash  
Relevant issues: [https://github.com/foss42/apidash/issues/271](https://github.com/foss42/apidash/issues/271)  

Idea description:  
DashBot is an AI-powered assistant embedded within the API Dash interface. The goal is to enhance user productivity and make API interactions more intuitive for developers by adding a chatbot-like UI that can assist with tasks such as generating API request bodies, interpreting responses, explaining headers/status codes, and helping debug errors.

The assistant would leverage a local or cloud-based LLM (initially using OpenAI API or similar), with future plans to make it pluggable and privacy-respecting. A floating or sidebar interface will house the chatbot, accessible from anywhere in the app.

**Approach:**
- Add a chatbot UI panel to the app interface.
- Create a service layer to call OpenAI API for intelligent interactions.
- Integrate context-awareness so DashBot can access current API request/response data.
- Allow quick actions like “Generate a request body” or “What does this error mean?”
- Optional: Make DashBot modular and pluggable for self-hosted models in the future.
