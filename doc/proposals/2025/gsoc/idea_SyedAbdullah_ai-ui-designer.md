Project Title: AI-Powered Dynamic UI Generator from API Responses


Relevant issues: #617
##About me
Hi, I'm Syed Abdullah, a passionate Software Engineer with over 2 years of experience building scalable and modern software solutions.
I'm a full-stack developer comfortable working across both frontend and backend, using C#, .NET Core, React, Flutter, and more. I'm also a beginner-level open-source contributor, continuously learning and giving back to the community.

Idea description:  
The goal of this project is to enhance API Dash by developing an AI-driven agent that automatically transforms API responses (e.g., JSON, XML) into intuitive, dynamic UI components like tables, cards, charts, and forms.
This eliminates the manual process of UI creation and helps developers interact with and visualize data effortlessly.

#### Key Features:
- Parse and understand API response structures in real-time.
- Automatically generate a corresponding UI schema/model (component layout).
- Render live previews of the generated UI in the app.
- Support customization: layout templates, filters, pagination, sorting, styles.
- Export the UI code (Flutter widgets or HTML/CSS snippets) for integration in web or mobile apps.
- Extensible system with support for plugins or future rendering engines (React, Vue, etc.).

#### Approach:
1. **Phase 1** – Build a response parser module that:
    - Parses JSON/XML structures.
    - Outputs a layout schema representing UI components.

2. **Phase 2** – Implement a dynamic UI renderer:
    - Converts the layout schema into interactive Flutter or Web UI.
    - Allows live preview inside API Dash.

3. **Phase 3** – Add customization tools:
    - Enable field selection, styling options, responsive layouts.
    - Add filtering/sorting controls in tables, date pickers, etc.

4. **Phase 4** – Code export and integration:
    - One-click export to Flutter widgets or reusable HTML/CSS components.
    - Optionally support importing layout templates.
    
This is my initial idea, kindly give me feedback on the idea and shall I move forward with the POC and all. Looking forward. Thanks
