### Motivation & Past Experience

Short answers to the following questions (Add relevant links wherever you can):
1. Have you worked on or contributed to a FOSS project before? 
  No, I haven't worked on FOSS project before, I am waiting to contribute.
2. What is your one project/achievement that you are most proud of? Why?
  One of my energetic projects is BlueVa, which is building logic using code-blocks provided, designed canvas to allow user make logic, 
  its like Java game for beginners to explore, so after completing canvas, this tool will generate code for logic and will show errors if any.
  This project is like teaching a language, so this project made me teach and understand what and how I did things.
3. What kind of problems or challenges motivate you the most to solve them?
  Puzzles are most motivating challenges, cause they dont have straight solution, they give space to think and analyse and every analysis will contribute to solutionn somehow.
  So such puzzles in development are optimization, scalability, real-time analysis. So these kind of challenges will try to solve.
4. Will you be working on GSoC full-time? In case not, what will you be studying or working on while working on the project?
  I will be working completely on GSoC and open-source contribution.
5. Do you mind regularly syncing up with the project mentors?
  If project needs regular-syncups then it is good to have them.
6. What interests you the most about API Dash?
  I worked on APIs recently, so now this API Dash will make to go in more deeper thoughts about api and api-testing.
7. Can you mention some areas where the project can be improved?
  AI-driven api-testing and making suggestions for possible improvements for endpoints.

### Project Proposal Information

1. Proposal Title : AI-Powered API Testing and Tool Integration
2. Abstract: 
  Integrating APIs with AI agent frameworks like crewAI, smolagent, pydantic-ai, or langgraph 
  requires manual conversion of API endpoints into tool definitions-another time-intensive process.
  This project aims to automate and enhance these workflows using Large Language Models (LLMs), making
  API testing and integration smarter, faster, and developer-friendly

3. Detailed Description  
To build an AI agent that:
    -Automates API testing using prompts.
    -Converts APIs (OpenAPI specs or raw documentation) into structured tool definitions for testing
    -Benchmarks and evaluates LLMs for optimal performance in test generation and tool creation
    -Integrates with agent frameworks like crewAI, smolagent, pydantic-ai, and langgraph as mentioned

4. Weekly Timeline: 

Week 1-2: Research & Planning
- Finalize target frameworks and API formats
- Research best-fit LLMs 
- Define API testing criteria and tool definition schemas
Week 3-4: API Parsing & Tool Generation Module
- Build parsers for OpenAPI and Swagger 
- Generate tool definitions for popular agent frameworks 
Week 5-6: API Testing Engine
- Accept natural language test scenarios 
- Generate test cases 
- Execute tests and validate responses
Week 7-8: Agent Framework Integration
- Wrap test functions for agent compatibility
 - Build CLI and optional Flutter web frontend
Week 9: Benchmarking & Evaluation
- Create a benchmark dataset
- Compare LLMs for performance and cost
Week 10: Finalize
- Documentation and demo 
This timeline has significant flexibility to add or modify tasks.

#Tools
- Languages: Python, Dart (for optional Flutter frontend)
- Frameworks: crewAI, smolagent, pydantic-ai, langgraph (as mentioned)
- LLMs: GPT-4, Claude
- Libraries: LangChain, FastAPI, httpx
- Others : Docker, Git, Jupyter, pytest
