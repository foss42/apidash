## Project Title
AI UI Designer for APIs

## Synopsis
This project will develop an AI-based agent that transforms API responses (like JSON and XML) into usable UI components (forms, tables, charts, etc.) with built-in customization and export options.

## Benefits to the Community
This will streamline API testing, visualization, and UI generation — saving developers time and effort.

## Deliverables
- JSON/XML parser
- Component generator (table, card, form, chart)
- Customization controls (filters, pagination)
- UI export options (Flutter/Web)
- Documentation + tests


## Motivation
As a developer passionate about user experience and automation, I’ve always found API tools fascinating — they bridge human interaction and technical infrastructure. When I explored API Dash, its focus on speed, clarity, and minimalism stood out from other tools I’ve used.

What excites me most about this project is the challenge of turning raw API data into something meaningful and visual, especially through dynamic UI generation. I enjoy frontend development, but also love working under the hood with JSON, schema parsing, and smart layout logic — this project sits at the perfect intersection of those interests.

Beyond the technical scope, I’m driven by the potential impact on accessibility and education. By making complex APIs easier to understand and interact with, we empower students, developers from non-traditional backgrounds, and contributors around the world — especially those in international or low-resource settings.

Contributing to a tool that’s free, open-source, and community-driven means a lot to me. GSoC is not just an opportunity to build something great, but to grow through mentorship and collaboration, while helping shape a more inclusive and impactful developer ecosystem.


## ✨ Benefits to the Community

This project directly strengthens the core value of API Dash — speed, clarity, and accessibility — by making API responses instantly visual and interactive.

By enabling automatic UI generation from JSON or XML, we reduce the friction for developers to test, debug, and understand APIs. This is especially helpful for beginners, educators, and teams building internal tools.

It enhances API Dash’s flexibility across diverse use cases — from prototyping and documentation to integration testing — and lowers the barrier to entry for developers across experience levels.

This project also supports accessibility goals: visualizing APIs helps neurodiverse learners and non-native English speakers better grasp complex structures.

Finally, well-tested, reusable UI components and improved docs will help API Dash scale better, attract more contributors, and evolve as a leading open-source dev tool.


## 📦 Deliverables

### Phase 1 (Before Midterm Evaluation)

- ✅ **Component Generator v1:** Basic generation of UI components like tables, key-value cards, and simple forms.
- ✅ **Live Preview Panel:** Preview generated UI in real-time as API response is received.
- ✅ **Customization Panel (Basic):** Allow user to toggle between different UI layouts (table, card, raw JSON view).
- ✅ **Docs & Tests:** Documentation for codebase and test coverage for core modules.

### Phase 2 (Post Midterm to Final Evaluation)
- ✅ **Advanced Component Generator:** Support nested data, arrays, empty states, pagination, filters, and dynamic layout resizing.
- ✅ **Export Feature:** One-click export to Dart (Flutter) or HTML code snippets for integration in user apps.
- ✅ **Theming & Styling Options:** Let users configure color schemes, borders, spacing, and responsive breakpoints.

## 🔭 Future Work & Stretch Goals

- **OpenAPI Integration**: Add deeper support for parsing OpenAPI specs to auto-generate full UI forms and authentication flows.
- **Community Templates**: Let users contribute and share UI templates for common APIs (e.g., weather, finance, AI).
- **AI Enhancements**: Train a basic model to suggest UI layouts based on API response types.
- **Plugin Support**: Modularize the generator so new components (e.g., chart, maps) can be added easily by the community.
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Explore syncing API workspace editing in real-time (like a Google Docs for APIs).

These goals can be taken up post-GSoC as future enhancements or extended during GSoC depending on the project pace.




## 🛠 Technical Approach

The core goal is to build an intelligent system that takes raw API responses (JSON/XML) and transforms them into dynamic UI components, with customization and export support.

### 1. **Parsing API Responses**
- Analyze structure of JSON/XML data (using `json_serializable`, `xml`, or similar Dart packages).
- Identify key-value pairs, arrays, nested objects to determine appropriate UI widgets.

### 2. **Component Mapping Engine**
- Build a mapping system that links data types → UI components:
  - String → TextField
  - Boolean → Toggle/Switch
  - List → Dropdown
  - Object → Card or Nested Form
- Handle nested data recursively.

### 3. **Dynamic UI Generation**
- Generate Flutter widgets using a tree structure.
- Allow instant preview and live editing (padding, styling, layout).
- Scaffold reusable components: `DataCard`, `AutoForm`, `APIGrid`, etc.

### 4. **Customization Support**
- Allow users to tweak:
  - Layout: vertical/horizontal/grid
  - Visibility toggles
  - Labels, styles, colors
- Provide real-time preview and export to Dart code.

### 5. **Export Functionality**
- Convert the generated UI into clean, production-ready Flutter code.
- Package as a `.dart` file, downloadable or savable to project workspace.

### 6. **Optional AI Assist**
- Use basic ML heuristics or an LLM API to recommend layout structures or group similar fields (as a stretch goal).
