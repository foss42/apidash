## Executive Summary

This document presents a comprehensive threat model for API Dash using the STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) framework. API Dash is a cross-platform API testing client built with Flutter that allows users to create, test, and manage API requests locally on their devices.

### Key Risk Areas Identified:
1. **High Priority**: Information disclosure of sensitive API credentials and tokens
2. **High Priority**: Tampering with stored API requests and collections
3. **Medium Priority**: Local data security and encryption
4. **Medium Priority**: Code generation security vulnerabilities

## 1. System Overview

### 1.1 Architecture Context

API Dash is a Flutter-based desktop and mobile application that:
- Runs locally on user devices (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, iPad)
- Stores data locally using Hive database
- Does not require backend servers or cloud services
- Supports multiple API types: HTTP, GraphQL, SSE/Streaming, AI
- Generates integration code in 35+ languages/libraries
- Imports collections from Postman, cURL, Insomnia, OpenAPI, HAR formats
- Integrates with AI models via Ollama for API testing assistance

### 1.3 Data Flow

1. **User Input** → API Request Configuration (URL, headers, body, authentication)
2. **Local Storage** → Hive database stores requests, collections, history, settings
3. **Network Request** → Direct HTTP calls to target APIs
4. **Response Handling** → Display/store API responses (including multimedia)
5. **Code Generation** → Transform requests into code snippets
6. **Export/Import** → HAR, Postman, Insomnia, OpenAPI formats
7. **AI Integration** → Send prompts to local Ollama instance for assistance

### 1.4 Trust Boundaries

- **User Device Boundary**: All data resides locally on user's device
- **Network Boundary**: Outbound connections to user-specified APIs
- **File System Boundary**: Local storage for collections, history, settings
- **Process Boundary**: Flutter app process with OS-level isolation
- **AI Service Boundary**: Optional external connection to local Ollama instance

## 5. Assumptions and Constraints

### 5.1 Security Assumptions

1. **Local-First Design**: API Dash is primarily a local application without cloud backend
2. **User Trust**: Users are trusted to configure and use the application appropriately
3. **OS Security**: Underlying OS provides basic security (sandboxing, file permissions)
4. **No Authentication**: Application itself has no authentication mechanism
5. **Open Source**: All code is publicly visible for security review
6. **No Remote Control**: No remote management or control features

### 5.2 Out of Scope

The following are explicitly out of scope for this threat model:

1. Physical security of user devices
2. User's network security and infrastructure
3. Security of target APIs being tested
4. Social engineering attacks against users
5. Insider threats from legitimate users
6. Legal/compliance aspects beyond technical controls
7. Third-party service security (Ollama, external APIs)

### 5.3 Constraints

1. **Open Source**: Cannot implement security through obscurity
2. **Cross-Platform**: Solutions must work across all supported platforms
3. **User Experience**: Security controls must not significantly degrade UX
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Must maintain data compatibility with existing users
5. **Resource Limitations**: Open source project with limited dedicated security resources
6. **Performance**: Security controls must not significantly impact performance

---

## 6. Security Architecture Recommendations

### 6.1 Secure-by-Default Configuration

```dart
// Example: Default secure settings
class SecurityDefaults {
  static const bool httpsOnly = false; // Warning shown for HTTP
  static const bool encryptLocalData = true; // Encrypt sensitive data
  static const bool useOSKeychain = true; // Use OS credential storage
  static const bool clearClipboardAfter = 30; // seconds
  static const int maxResponseSize = 100; // MB
  static const int historyRetentionDays = 30;
  static const bool incognitoMode = false; // Don't save history
  static const bool maskCredentialsInUI = true;
}
```
