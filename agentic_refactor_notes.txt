Project: API Dash (FOSS42)
Contributor: AI/ML Engineer | Full-Stack Developer
Scope: Strengthening Agentic Services Pipeline

Core Improvements:

Standardized Regex Cleaning: Replaced brittle, hardcoded .replaceAll chains with a robust RegExp(r'```[a-zA-Z]*\n?|```') across all agents (BodyGen, FuncGen, StacGen, StacModifier). This ensures markdown artifacts from any LLM do not corrupt the JSON payload.

Schema Validation: Implemented jsonDecode validation in the validator() methods for all code-generating agents. This prevents "logic leaks" where malformed AI output could crash the UI or API calls.

Semantic Integrity: Enhanced the ResponseSemanticAnalyser with strict plain-text paragraph validation to ensure the "Brain" of the pipeline provides clean, descriptive context for downstream agents.

Orchestrator Alignment: Updated apidash_agent_calls.dart to sync with refined output keys (REQUEST_BODY), ensuring the orchestrator and agents communicate without null-reference errors.

Impact: Increased the resilience of the Generative AI features against non-deterministic model responses, making the transition between different LLM providers (Gemini, local models, etc.) significantly more stable.
